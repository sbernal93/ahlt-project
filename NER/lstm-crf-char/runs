0 -> initial run
1 -> act to relu
2 -> back to softmax, SpatialDropout1D to 0.5
3 -> SpatialDropout1D to 0.8, 10 epochs
4 -> main lstm units to 500
5 -> batch size to 64, units to 50
6 -> units to 100
7 -> revert units, rec dropouts to 0.8
8 -> validation_split to 0.2, dense to 100, max_len_char to 5
9 -> max len to 10
10 -> linear act
