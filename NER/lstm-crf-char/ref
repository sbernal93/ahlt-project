" classifier being the linear-chain Conditional Random Fields (CRF),
Structural Support Vector Machines (S-SVM) and maximum-entropy classifiers.
The drawback of this approach is that feature engineering can be ofte
as time-consuming as the manual design of rules."

 However, drug and clinical concept recognition are very domain-specific tasks,
and many words might not appear in general-domain datasets. In order to
assign word embeddings to these specialized words, the embedding
algorithms need to be retrained using medical domain resources
such as the MIMIC-III corpora [10]
